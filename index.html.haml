  %h1 Debezium
  %h3 Stream changes from your databases.
  %p Debezium is an open source distributed platform for change data capture. Start it up, point it at your databases, and your apps can start responding to all of the inserts, updates, and deletes that other apps commit to your databases. Debezium is durable and fast, so your apps can respond quickly and never miss an event, even when things go wrong.

    %h2 Do more with your data
    %p Your data is always changing -- imagine being able to react every time your data changed. Debezium makes this easy, without having to change your apps that modify the data. Debezium continuously monitors your databases and lets any of your applications stream every row-level change in the same order they were committed to the database. Use the event streams to purge a cache, update search indexes, generate derived views and data, keep other data sources in sync, and much more. In fact, pull that functionality out of your app and into separate services.

    %h2 Simplify your apps
    %p Since Debezium can monitor your data, why have your applications update the database <em>and</em> update search indexes <em>and</em> send notifications <em>and</em> publish messages? Doing that correctly -- even when things go wrong -- is really tough, and if you get it wrong the data in those system may be inconsistent. Keep things simple, and move that extra functionality into separate services that use Debezium.

    %h2 Durable and consistent.
    %p Never miss a change in data. Take your apps and service down for maintenance, and Debezium keeps monitoring so that when your apps come back up they'll continue exactly where they left off. No matter what, Debezium keeps the events in the same order they were made to the database. And Debezium makes sure that you always see every event, even when things go wrong.

    %h3 Fast
    %p When all things are running smoothly, Debezium is fast. And that means your apps and services can react quickly. Debezium is built on top of <a href="http://kafka.apache.org">Apache Kafka</a>, which is proven, scalable, and handles very large volumes of data very quickly.
