== Time to Upgrade

Debezium version link:/blog/2021/06/30/debezium-1-6-final-released/[1.6.0.Final] was released last week.

The past Debezium releases were focused on stabilizing the Oracle connector based on LogMiner, providing more resilient options for snapshotting (re-snapshotting specific tables, filter changes, parallelized snapshotting, etc.),
adding support for Redis Streams in Debezium Server, the reworking of the MySQL connector to have a common connector framework, and handling several parser-related bugs.

If you are using an older version, we urge you to check out the latest major release.
For details on the bug fixes, enhancements, and improvements that spanned 5 releases, check out the link:/releases/1.6/release-notes/[release-notes].

The Debezium team has also begun active development on the next major version, 1.7.
The major focus in 1.7 is implementing incremental snapshotting for more connectors (MongoDB, Oracle), reworking the transaction buffer for the Oracle connector,
and expanding the Debezium UI. For details on the further upcoming release check out the link:/docs/roadmap/[Debezium Roadmap].

Keep an eye on our link:/releases/[releases page] to get a jump start on what bug fixes, enhancements, and changes will be coming in 1.7 as they become available.
