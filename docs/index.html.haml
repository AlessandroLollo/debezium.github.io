  Debezium is a set of distributed services to capture changes in your databases so that your applications and see those changes and respond to them. 
  Debezium records all row-level changes within each database table in a 
  %i
    change event stream
  \, and applications simply read these streams to see the change events in the same order in which they occurred.
