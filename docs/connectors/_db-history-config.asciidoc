=== Database History Configuration Properties

The connector's `database.history` property defines where the connector will store the history of the database schema. By default the connector will store them in Kafka.

==== Storing in Kafka

The following configuration properties are required when the connector's `database.history` configuration property is set to the default value of `io.debezium.relational.history.KafkaDatabaseHistory`:

[cols="35%a,10%a,55%a",options="header,footer",role="table table-bordered table-striped"]
|=======================
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`database.history.kafka.topic` 
|
|The full name of the Kafka topic where the connector will store the database schema history.

|`database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers` 
|
|A list of host/port pairs that the connector will use for establishing an initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This connection will be used to retrieving database schema history previously stored by the connector, and for writing each DDL statement read from the source database. This should point to the same Kafka cluster used by the Kafka Connect process.
|=======================

The following advanced configuration properties may be set when the connector's `database.history` configuration property is set to the default value of `io.debezium.relational.history.KafkaDatabaseHistory`:

[cols="35%a,10%a,55%a",options="header,footer",role="table table-bordered table-striped"]
|=======================
|Property
|Default
|Description

|`database.history.kafka.recovery.poll.interval.ms` 
|`100`
|An integer value that specifies the maximum number of milliseconds the connector should wait during startup/recovery while polling for persisted data. The default is 100ms.

|`database.history.kafka.recovery.attempts` 
|`4`
|The maximum number of times that the connector should attempt to read persisted history data before the connector recovery fails with an error. The maximum amount of time to wait after receiving no data is `recovery.attempts` x `recovery.poll.interval.ms`.
