Debezium's SQL Server connector can monitor and record all of the row-level changes in the databases on an SQL Server instance (Standard and Enterprise editions).
This connector is at an early stage of development and considered an incubating feature as of Debezium 0.9.
It is not feature-complete (most notably, there's no support for DDL changes while the connector is running) and the structure of emitted CDC messages may change in future revisions.
